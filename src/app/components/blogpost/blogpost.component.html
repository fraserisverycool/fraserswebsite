<h1>Games Fraser played in 2023</h1>
<p>Welcome to my list of games I played this year! Normally I do this on twitter but twitter is lame so I made this website instead. The list is roughly in order of best to worst but don’t read too much into that. I wrote some thoughts about the games as well, sometimes a lot, sometimes not much at all.</p>
<h2>Pizza Tower</h2>
<img class="img-responsive" src="assets/pizzatower.png" width="600">
<p>This game is amazing. Start by listening to the soundtrack:</p>

</p>
<p>The VIBES are off the CHARTS. They really made a game that looks like it was made in microsoft paint? Iconic. The music has no business being this good for such a goofy looking game.</p>
<p>There are so many fun ideas and fun levels, and it really makes you want to play the game well. You can’t die in the levels, but you WANT a good score. Going back and redoing levels for a higher score is a lot of fun. The game is based off of Wario Land 4, which happens to be one of my favourite games from my childhood. They took that concept and fucking ran with it. This spiritual successor surpasses the classic!</p>
<h2>Anodyne 2: Return to Dust</h2>
<img class="img-responsive" src="assets/anodyne.png" width="600">
<p>This game blew me away. Very hard to describe what it’s about but here we go. You start the game inside an egg and you have to be born, but not before you get some kind of seed implanted inside of you. You are tasked by what appears to be a religious entity (the Centre) to rid the world of dust and bring about the Anodyne, something like a rapture (the word “anodyne” means painkiller). As you go around removing the evil dust, the seed inside you watches as you do your job. The evil dust affects the citizens of the weird and wonderful world, and you remove it, numbing the pain and “clarifying” things for them.</p>
<p>As you go through the game, doing your job and meeting all these suffering people, you realise the game relates a lot to the human experience. There are many points in the game where you can draw parallels to how we grow up, how our parents affect us, our relationship with entities like “the Centre”, and many many other things. The game is dripping with meaning.</p>
<p>It also has an immaculate vibe. The world looks like a PS1 game, polygons and everything, but it also has nice lighting. The colour palette makes it look dreamy. It also looks dumb and trashy and low budget and I love that. There are also some 2D sections for when you shrink down to a miniscule size in order to clean the dust, and they are delightful. IF you’Re interested, give this track from an opening area a listen:

<h2>Ghost Trick: Phantom Detective</h2>
<img class="img-responsive" src="assets/ghosttrick.jpg" width="600">
<p>This is such a charming game. It’s absolutely OOZING with style. It’s kooky, silly and over-dramatic, and I love it. It’s a remake of a classic investigation game from the DS that came out on switch and I highly recommend it. Fans of Ace Attorney should be all over this.</p>
<h2>Pikmin 4</h2>
<img class="img-responsive" src="assets/pikmin.jpg" width="600">
<p>I love Pikmin with my whole heart. There's something special about it. The combination of the focus on nature, the soundtrack, the wacky characters, and the kinda dark elements combine to give it a certain X factor which is hard to pin down with words. When I think about whether games are good, they can get approval from me for a variety of reasons. Like Slay the spire is just great gameplay. But most of my favourite games just have great vibes.</p>
<p>The vibe of pikmin is so fucking strong that it's insane, and the gameplay is good enough that it's fun to spend time in the game soaking up the vibe. The first pikmin arguably had the worst gameplay but the strongest vibe. The time limit, as well as harshness of the environment, and some highlights like the first encounters with specific bosses. Lots of bullshit with pikmin killing themselves, general difficulty. It is a great time and might be my favourite pikmin.</p>
<p>The second pikmin game is a lot bigger and also has vibes in spades. The areas are super nice, music is fantastic (I love the piklopedia), and gameplay significantly improved with having two captains. The caves seemed pretty random though - like time stops when you're down there and then you've just got this ability to go back to the previous floor if you lose too many pikmin. I feel like it takes away from the general feeling of the game, and it's more like bonus content.</p>
<p>Pikmin 3 is super interesting. It's fucking gorgeous, has beautiful areas and possibly the best music of all. It also does away with the caves, and instead just has a really big overworld, which brings back that pikmin 1 vibe a lot. I never liked how the treasures were just fruits though, that seemed pointless. It also added mission mode, which was the best thing ever in terms of gameplay - these super fun little challenge modes. The final boss was also very special.</p>
<p>Now after 10 years we finally get Pikmin 4 and I have been excited for it, even more so than for Zelda. In terms of gameplay, everything is there. Quality of life changes to the max, meaning that pikmin actually do what they're told, all the pikmin content you could wish for. All the old bosses coming back, caves, hours of gameplay. I had a fun time collecting all the treasures and completing everything.</p>
<p>But something's off. The game feels like a huge collection of content being thrown in. More is more! The caves are more content, the dandori challenges (like pikmin 3 mission mode) are great but integrated into the game like extra content. They brought back the (terrifying in pikmin 2) waterwraith and it felt empty. It just dropped two of them in the final dungeon. Doing that really takes away the special vibe of that particular boss. I realised that in pikmin 4, vibe was sacrificed for more content, and that this is true for many games these days.</p>
<p>The quality of life changes &amp; powered up rewind function makes it so it's very easy to get through the game without losing pikmin, so stakes are way lower now. I think I miss the chaos of the first two pikmins where one misstep can cause your whole squad to get flattened without warning. Electricity immediately killing them, the gatling groinks, yellows throwing bombs back at you. There's something delicious about that.</p>
<p>On top of that, the music isn't so great. The Olimar sidequest tracks are great, but otherwise it's gone a different direction: now it has ultra adaptive music (something the series is famous for and a big contributor to the X factor) but it's so adaptive to the point it's barely recognisable. There are multiple layers which fade in and out depending on what enemy you're fighting, what you're carrying etc. Nothing you can hum.</p>
<p>They also retconned the lore, and it was "all a dream" or something. They had Louie be the bad guy but then cleared things up after, and there were no open questions left like in Pikmin 2. There was no weird shit like the Pikmin 3 final boss. And final complaint: I wish they integrated the night time/glow pikmin sections better.</p>
<p>But to end on a positive, I really loved getting platinum medals in the dandori challenges, and those final ones were tough as nails. I still loved this game. I even painted a picture of Oatchi for my living room!</p>
<h2>The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom</h2>
<img class="img-responsive" src="assets/tears.jpg" width="600">
<p>Playing this game felt a lot like playing Breath of the Wild back in 2017, although it has to be said: nothing can truly recreate that feeling of magic we all felt back then. It’s undeniably a better game, but some of that magic is gone the second time around. It’s super interesting because it’s forcing me to reflect on why I enjoyed playing BotW more, despite it being emptier and more annoying. How we enjoy games really depends on so many things, not just the game itself. In this case, it was because there really wasn’t anything like it before.</p>
<p>Anyway here we are in 2023 playing Zelda again and it’s a lot of fun. The new abilities are nice. I was actually in it for the new content, music, areas and surprises though. There was a lot to enjoy, but it really does rely on existing content a bit too much. I wish exploring Hyrule wasn’t so similar to how it was before.</p>
<p>I really loved some of the new stuff though. The new temples, great! Especially that gorgeous Lightning Temple music, hell yes. Getting from A to B using a ratchet flying machine, great. First time falling into a chasm? Terrifying. This gorgeous version of Lookout Landing after you meet all the sages:<a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VbNjXSRRQU&amp;ab_channel=Yoshi%27sVGM">

<h2>Pokemon Trading Card Game (GB)</h2>
<img class="img-responsive" src="assets/pokemon.jpg" width="600">
<p>Mate. This game slaps. I never would have thought that the original Gameboy Colour version of the fucking Pokemon Trading Card Game would be so good. I’m pretty sure the actual card game is super unbalanced and bullshit, but these battles are a lot of fun. It’s genuinely a pleasure to build decks and fight with them, and it’s hard to describe why.</p>
<p>I immediately got attached to Staryu, because it can do 20 damage with one energy, and also happens to be one of my favourite pokemon. My water &amp; rock deck took me through almost the whole game and I even felt proud of it.</p>
<p>The art of the pokemon is sooo good. I’ve already cross-stitched Horsea and Koffing from this game. And the music is super good for a gameboy game as well. It’s on the switch online for free, so definitely play it!</p>
<h2>Wario Ware: Move It!</h2>
<img class="img-responsive" src="assets/warioware.jpg" width="600">
<p>This is a delightful party game! It really nails my humour. I played it at christmas with some friends and we had a great time. If you love motion controls, give it a go!</p>
<h2>Cocoon</h2>
<img class="img-responsive" src="assets/cocoon.jpg" width="600">
<p>I had such a laugh playing through this game with my friend Fab. We did it in one evening, making sex jokes the whole time, seeing as it’s a game about balls. As we progressed through, the game assaulted us with more and more vaginal imagery. Lots of imagery surrounding childbirth, wombs, balls shooting through tubes, phalluses. The real deal. I couldn’t not see it.</p>
<p>The puzzles got really good towards the end. I love a good puzzle game and this one blew my mind. It was so clean and polished as well. At many points in the game we nodded and said “...game design”. This had clearly been designed by a real game designer yknow. Actually I wondered if it was a little too over-engineered, taking away the magic a bit. But I couldn’t deny that the little game design things they implemented were all great. Things like old paths closing off if it’s definitely the wrong way to go, or pleasant music playing when you start solving a puzzle in the right way.</p>
<h2>Super Mario Bros Wonder</h2>
<img class="img-responsive" src="assets/mario.jpg" width="600">
<p>This game is delightful, perfect for co-op and full of great things that I greatly appreciate (elephants, nonsense, random shit). I like that the wonder flowers were like drugs. The final level was really good.</p>
<p>It has to be said though: this game is just another mario. Mario will always be mario… it’s just the same game with more vibe, personality and style.</p>
<h2>Vampire Survivors</h2>
<img class="img-responsive" src="assets/vampire.jpg" width="600">
<p>God this game is like crack. Instantly addictive. I touched it and was sucked inside like a loser, there was nothing I could do. Once I sniffed the potential of the garlic item, and felt the excitement of ripping through endless hordes of enemies with it, I was hooked. By the end, my eyes were glazing over as I watched the screen flash very aggressively at me, the screen full of effects, enemies, GARLIC, destruction, wave after wave.</p>
<p>It’s good.</p>
<h2>Chants of Sennaar</h2>
<img class="img-responsive" src="assets/chants.jpg" width="600">
<p>This is a game perfect for fans of “Return of the Obra Dinn”, languages and games with great vibes. It has an artstyle similar to that of “Sable”, another game on the list that I want to play. It looks fantastic.</p>
<p>It’s all about learning new languages! Everyone speaks using these glyphs which correspond neatly to concepts, objects and verbs. Learning vocabulary using puzzles is already really cool, but it also forces you to think about grammar to a small extent, which for me as a linguistics nerd was super fun (and easy!). It starts off pretty easy but then they introduce a second new language and shit starts getting real.</p>
<p>I highly recommend it!</p>
<h2>Kirby’s Return to Dreamland Deluxe</h2>
<img class="img-responsive" src="assets/kirby.jpg" width="600">
<p>A delightful game! I missed out on it when it came out on the Wii, despite adoring Nightmare in Dreamland and Amazing Mirror. It’s great, and this remake looks real nice. I love the outlines on the characters. It’s short, doesn’t overstay its welcome and features some fun minigames.</p>
<h2>Fire Emblem Engage</h2>
<img class="img-responsive" src="assets/fireemblem.jpg" width="600">
<p>This game, man. It’s just so camp! The theatrics of it… it definitely doesn’t take itself seriously and is better off because of it. The story is about war and normal fire emblem stuff, but then the characters are just so ridiculous. Every chapter there is a new ridiculously dressed person who joins your party and you just have to take it as it is. It’s actually really funny and entertaining because of that.</p>
<p>I’m a long time Fire Emblem fan, so I’m used to the gameplay and I enjoyed it! This time for the first time I played on casual mode (as opposed to classic mode, where you have permadeath) and it GREATLY improved my gameplay experience. I didn’t have to reset when someone got hit with a critical hit! I should have used this option the whole time. To balance it out, I also played on hard mode, which made the game more fun, although I was resentful that my playtime extended very long because of it. Also a little bit of me is unsatisfied because I switched it to normal difficulty for the final boss… I just ran out of patience.</p>
<p>This game brings back 12 main characters from previous fire emblem games as the “emblems” which I thoroughly enjoyed. I am a total sucker for this kind of thing - references to older games, representation of different eras… I loved seeing Micaiah from Fire Emblem Radiant Dawn, or Eirika from Sacred Stones. So cool. I just wish the emblems actually had personalities. They are all boring as hell.</p>
<p>Anyway shoutouts to Goldmary who is that real bitch.</p>
<h2>Super Mario RPG</h2>
<img class="img-responsive" src="assets/rpg.jpg" width="600">
<p>This game is delightful! I’ve always been meaning to play it so I was super happy to see it remade on the switch. The whole thing is very quaint. I love the chibi characters, and I adore Mallow. Geno is by comparison very boring - I’m asking myself why so many people wanted him in Smash.</p>
<p>I will say the game got a little boring and also easy. It’s not exactly gripping, and the battles are only a little bit fun. If you play it, I would do it for the vibe and the chill ride, and for the history. Personally I love to play classic games and learn how lots of old Nintendo stuff came to be. For example, this game is where Bowser’s personality was first defined!</p>
<h2>Sea of Stars</h2>
<img class="img-responsive" src="assets/seaofstars.jpg" width="600">
<p>I put 30 hours into this game. At some point when I realised this wasn't going to be the best video game ever I decided to enjoy my time with it by just vibing through it, which was easy because the vibes are so strong.</p>
<p>One thing I look for the most in games is a good vibe, which is often from a combination of characters, environments, colour palettes, art, dialogue and most importantly, music. Sea of stars has just such a great vibe. I really enjoy the character designs and the environments and the lighting especially. There's an ability that lets you change the time of day and it looks soooo good, I've never seen anything like it.</p>
<p>The music is also really good, I like the moorlands music a lot:
  <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AkEN4ATb-xo">
    <span style="color:rgb(17, 85, 204);">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AkEN4ATb-xo</span>
  </a>
</p>
<p>There's a few gameplay elements which make it not the best game ever. The battle system is a lot of fun, especially with the timed inputs and breaking of opponent's big moves, and I never groaned when I had a battle. However it doesn't have too much depth. It takes a long time before the characters learn any new attacks and when they do, they're never gamechanging. In fact I spent all the game using moonerang because it's simply the strongest attack. On top of that, one of the moves 'disorient' can really be abused to stop bosses ever doing their strong attack, which resulted in me missing all exciting animations from the final boss, which was a bit lame.</p>
<p>Next part has some light story spoilers…</p>
<p>The worst thing about this game though, is that the two main characters are plain and boring. They have no personality, they just go around winning battles and solving problems like boring heroes. How did they survive 10 years of isolation and training and then become perfectly well rounded heroes? The previous solstice warriors ended up not being well-rounded at all. The other characters are also pretty plain, with the exception of Resh'an, which was a genuine pleasant surprise. I appreciate that there was little dialogue, because it gave off those old fashioned SNES vibes, but it did mean that there was little to no character development. It's a shame because I like the designs.</p>
<p>When it comes to world building, I have a couple of questions. If we're dealing with multiple timelines and universes, why are we just focusing on two of them? How did we end up consistently going between these two specifically using the vast sea of stars? Considering the name of the game is sea of stars, the whole concept isn't very well explored. I mean we got this insane, super cool warp sequence there, but even though we traverse the sea multiple times, we never see that again.</p>
<p>One thing about the lore which I did enjoy were the stories told by Teaks. They're perfect fantasy fairytales which work really well with the minimal dialogue, set to nice music and revealed at points in the story when you haven't figured it out yourself yet.</p>
<p>In conclusion, this is a game which does have that X factor which is so rare in the wealth of video games we are bombarded with these days, but it has some things holding it back from being one of my favourites. I did push through all 30 hours though, which says something</p>
<h2>F-Zero 99</h2>
<img class="img-responsive" src="assets/fzero.jpg" width="600">
<p>Mate this game has the best music.</p>
<p>
  <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJCmbipfnyA&amp;ab_channel=StigThomasEliassen">
    <span style="color:rgb(17, 85, 204);">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJCmbipfnyA&amp;ab_channel=StigThomasEliassen</span>
  </a>
</p>
<p>I’m just happy this game got some love this year and everyone played it for like a week. The F-Zero series is great and this was a great time.  It sucks that I could only ever end up playing on Mute City and Big Blue though.</p>
<h2>Street Fighter 6</h2>
<img class="img-responsive" src="assets/chunli.jpg" width="600">
<p>I really enjoyed playing this game with friends this summer. I love the character designs, and enjoyed learning the special inputs for Chun-Li’s moves. The single player mode is funny! It also has a fantastic vibe and soundtrack.</p>
<p>Sadly I don’t have time for a second competitive game next to smash, so I only played it for a short while. I would like to return to it.</p>
<h2>Signalis</h2>
<img class="img-responsive" src="assets/signalis.jpg" width="600">
<p>This is a very cerebral, abstract survival horror game. I didn’t truly understand what was going on in the story but the vibe was good. It’s apparently got Resident Evil 1 energy which is cool. It has a lot of German DDR in space energy if that makes sense.</p>
<p>I played it together with my friend Fab which was a great idea because the game is really scary and he could play through the difficult bits. After a while you become less scared of the monsters though which is good, although they always have newer scarier monsters waiting for you.</p>
<h2>Neon White</h2>
<img class="img-responsive" src="assets/neonwhite.jpg" width="600">
<p>This game’s story and characters are soooooo lame it’s hard to describe. Like it’s not even funny or enjoyable despite being bad like some of the games lower down on this list. And the general vibe isn’t very attractive I have to say.</p>
<p>But it’s super addictive. I really enjoyed playing it with my friend Fab and replaying the levels over and over. Deeply satisfying.</p>
<h2>The Looker</h2>
<img class="img-responsive" src="assets/looker.jpg" width="600">
<p>This game is made as an homage to another fantastic game “The Witness”. If you loved that like me, play this! It’s made by someone else but in the same style. It parodies the Witness in a really smart way. It’s nice and short, and free!</p>
<h2>Citizen Sleeper</h2>
<img class="img-responsive" src="assets/citizen.jpg" width="600">
<p>This is a small scale management game (and I play one management game a year for some reason) with a great vibe and setting. I really enjoyed the story and characters, and enjoyed how I could choose what happens to me. Multiple endings, lots of exciting stuff that happens, it’s a great little game!</p>
<h2>Stray</h2>
<img class="img-responsive" src="assets/stray.jpg" width="600">
<p>I played this together with my friend Fab - this is a great game to share with someone else. The premise is so good. You go around as a cat and it’s awesome. You can take naps, scratch at furniture, it’s really fantastic.</p>
<p>I really like the track that plays at the beginning of the game:
  <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w27KPzZ788&amp;list=PLUVDfcJiV5p8P_g80fT8LanjaqwzbxBIq&amp;ab_channel=Anupa06">
    <span style="color:rgb(17, 85, 204);">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w27KPzZ788&amp;list=PLUVDfcJiV5p8P_g80fT8LanjaqwzbxBIq&amp;ab_channel=Anupa06</span>
  </a>
</p>
<p>They put the cat in a crazy world with a crazy story, and you have to solve puzzles and have an understanding of your surroundings in a way that no cat ever could. The only explanation: you are a human trapped in the body of a cat! But that’s never confirmed or denied. In fact, the game suggests you’re just an insanely smart cat.</p>
<p>I found myself thinking to myself that a cat game doesn’t need to go this hard. It’s a bit much. But I enjoyed it a lot.</p>
<h2>The Legend of Zelda: Oracle of Ages</h2>
<img class="img-responsive" src="assets/oracle.png" width="600">
<p>One of my video game ambitions is to complete every Zelda game! So when this was released on the Nintendo Switch online, I decided it was time. Having played Oracle of Seasons already when I was younger, I was ready to fucking enjoy the shit out of this. But I have to say it’s not as good. There’s a bit too much bullshit, and it’s not well signposted. The seasons are cooler than the two timelines. It’s also kinda hard.</p>
<p>If you’re interested in the gameboy games, I would honestly just stick with Link’s Awakening, one of the best games ever.</p>
<h2>Death’s Door</h2>
<img class="img-responsive" src="assets/deathsdoor.jpg" width="600">
<p>This was recommended to me by my friend Fab who said it would scratch the itch left behind by “Tunic” last year. However he did not understand that Tunic cannot be replaced thanks to its incredible “learning as you progress” mechanic. Nonetheless, this plays a lot like Tunic and has an alright vibe and music. One of the bosses is this old lady which is cool. But this game is lacking in heart and soul. It’s a copy of this standard soulslike combat, with no new special mechanics or anything that sets it apart from other games.</p>
<h2>Banjo Kazooie</h2>
<img class="img-responsive" src="assets/banjo.jpg" width="600">
<p>One of my goals is to play, complete and understand all the games that the smash characters are from. I did play Banjo Kazooie as a child but I’m pretty sure I never completed it, so having recently got the Nintendo switch online expansion pass, I decided it was time to replay it!</p>
<p>Now in terms of vibes this game is off the charts. There is so much fun nonsense to enjoy. Absolute highlight for me is Brentilda, Gruntilda’s “nice” sister who is SUCH a bitch. She is just all over the map and all she does is hate on Gruntilda. It is so funny and I love the energy. Sometimes she’s hiding in a corner somewhere and just pops up to say that Gruntilda is disgusting because she eats maggots for breakfast. Sets me off everytime.</p>
<p>I have to say though. It’s a terrible game, it’s aged really badly. Collecting stuff isn’t actually that fun. Having to collect all the music notes from the start whenever you die is miserable, and the jiggies are not signposted properly. The music is really good though, but of course I would say that as a lover of Donkey Kong 64 (proven to be a terrible game).</p>
<p>I loved the final boss, because it was just a quiz. And Grunty is just so funny. Although, it turns out there’s a difficult actual boss battle with her if you collect almost all the collectables. I just noped out of that one and watched it on youtube in the name of self-care.</p>
<h2>Dr Mario 64</h2>
<img class="img-responsive" src="assets/drmario.jpg" width="600">
<p>Continuing the theme of playing games of smash characters, it was time to revisit the Dr Mario puzzle games and see what makes this game tick. As a big fan of Puyo Puyo Tetris (the best puzzle game ever) I was interested to see if this game had the same depth. Short answer: it doesn’t. You have to get lucky with the pills, because there isn’t a good strategy for what to do when you get the wrong pills. You have to constantly go for vertical rows of 4 because the horizontal ones are just so risky.</p>
<p>I don’t know if it’s like this in other Dr Mario games but on this one you play against an opponent and they send single blocks over and it just fucks with everything. If they fall down at the wrong time, you’re fucked and you have to restart, simple as that.</p>
<p>I managed to get through the story mode by getting lucky, waiting for my opponent to fail or occasionally clutching it out with some good gameplay. I did end up getting quite good at it because it is really fast paced. The final battle was really hard though, you needed that combo of good RNG and good execution. I did kinda enjoy getting that W in the end I won’t lie. Anyway this game isn’t good but I kinda enjoyed playing it on my switch over christmas.</p>
<h2>Spider-man 2</h2>
<img class="img-responsive" src="assets/spiderman.jpg" width="600">
<p>This game is super dumb. My friend Fab lent me the physical game and for some weird reason I ended up completing it. I admit that swinging around town is kinda fun, and towards the end I got better at the game and it was kinda satisfying using all the special abilities. That being said, I played the game on easy because I had no time for dying over and over against some goons.</p>
<p>Wild that this game has web slinging moments, watching a movie moments, and then they pad out the time with swinging fists at goons and even stealthing around (?). Luckily I didn’t need to stealth much because I was playing on easy. But it all felt very forced when I was doing all these epic stunts and then bam I’m in a building and have to fight some dudes for a bit.</p>
<p>But god the story is just so ridiculous. I mean it’s classic superhero nonsense and it’s why I don’t have any time for superhero films. There’s just so much ridiculousness, like these hunters. There’s this dude with too much money who likes hunting, and he has hundreds (thousands?) of loyal cultists who came with him from Foreign Country to New York, all of them willing to die for the cause. All trained in martial arts? There’s this character called Black Cat who randomly finds a magic portal. Like, just magic is a thing.</p>
<p>Venom as a thing is fascinating to me. How is this eldritch-horror ooze thing so popular? Everything surrounding this storyline was super predictable.</p>
<p>The worst offender for this game is the very generic soundtrack. Boring ass movie music with no character. They should have given this game an actual vibe like the into the spiderverse film. I also resented how everything just gets destroyed all the time. Spiderman and his escapades just end up destroying every environment they’re in.</p>
<p>I don’t recommend this game.</p>
<h2>Hifi Rush</h2>
<img class="img-responsive" src="assets/hifirush.png" width="600">
<p>I can’t describe why this game didn’t click with me. On paper, it looks great. I love rhythm games, and it seems innovative and funny. Looks like it was made with love. But I just wasn’t enjoying it. I guess it’s not my humour. And in my 2 or so hours with the game, the battle system didn’t click with me.</p>
<p>It kinda felt like I was playing some Content made by a Content Creator. I can almost picture the dev studio putting in all the elements to make a game which is enjoyed by the masses.</p>
<h2>Pentiment</h2>
<img class="img-responsive" src="assets/pentiment.jpg" width="600">
<p>This is a historically accurate visual novel about the middle ages. I picked it up because my friend Colin recommended it and I saw that one of my favourite artists (Lingua Ignota) sang a song on the soundtrack. The fact is, I’m not interested enough in history to get me through this slow-paced game. I gave up after the first major event happened and it became clear where the game was going.</p>
<h2>Monster Train</h2>

<p>Not in this list: Slay the Spire. I still love and am trying to get the elusive A20 Heart kills with characters that aren’t watcher. At some point I was reminded that there are other games like Slay the Spire that I should try, so I tried Monster Train. I didn’t really like it.</p>
<h2>Kingdom Hearts 1.5 Final Mix</h2>
<img class="img-responsive" src="assets/kingdomhearts.jpg" width="600">
<p>I’m on a challenge to play, complete and understand the essence of every game that the smash characters come from. This means that at some point I had to play Kingdom Hearts, and wow. This game is so so so bad. It has aged terribly.</p>
<p>It’s at the bottom of this list because it’s so bad and I wouldn’t recommend it to anyone. But I would be lying if I said I didn’t enjoy it. The moment the early 2000s vibe hit like a truck during the opening I knew I was in for a treat. The thought of this being the coolest game ever as a child is just so funny at every point in the game.</p>
<p>I should have known what I was in for in the opening section on the island, where the most annoying music ever played in a very short loop and I had to do nonsense tasks for my friends. After that I was treated to a bewildering story and game with many difficulty spikes, many points where I had no idea where to go, and many times having to look up a walkthrough.</p>
<p>The disney worlds, one of the most bewildering aspects of the game, are so tiny and bland it’s funny. I was just amazed that they managed to secure the rights to all these characters and worlds. Although by the end, having had my standards set so low, I found myself forming opinions on them. Why does Neverland only take place on a boat? It was kinda cool that you can be a mermaid in Atlantica… and the music in Agrabah isn’t too bad. Those gummi ship sections though, terrible.</p>
<p>I never truly understood how to use all the items. I spent a lot of the time without any proper weapons, nerfing myself to the point where bosses were endless HP sponges. I just assumed that’s how the game was meant to be. I guess I’ve been trained by modern games to be signposted stuff like that.</p>
<p>The cutscenes and dialog, the edginess, the characters… the whole thing is wild. I’ll never forget playing this game.</p>
<h2>Kingdom Hearts Re:Chain of Memories</h2>
<img class="img-responsive" src="assets/chainofmemories.jpg" width="600">
<p>I was challenged to play all the Kingdom Hearts games in order and I got the collection on playstation so I thought, why the fuck not, let’s play this spin off card game. Shit is WEIRD.</p>
<p>It’s an action game like the main one, except the attack you do depends on what your next card is. So in order to get good at the game you have to manage your cards, and also fight in a 3D arena like in the first game. All is well and good but then you meet some boss and it’s impossible to get past. I personally struggled with this bitch Larxene (shown in pic) halfway through the game. She is such a bitch I hate her so much.</p>
<p>It completely recycles all the assets from the first game and just tells another bewildering story. At this point I’m just letting it all wash over me. We are introduced to a bizarre shadowy organisation full of villains who all speak with an irritating sarcastic tone constantly. It’s a wonder that any of these characters get anything done because they don’t know how to communicate at all.</p>
<p>At some point in the game I decided I was in too deep and committed to completing the whole thing. I was forced to look up tactics for how to cheese some of these bosses because towards the end those health bars end up being ridiculously big. Cheesing works to an extent, but I have to admit, I had to get kinda good at the game to beat the bosses… maybe it wasn’t so bad.</p>
<p>What was bad was realising that when I completed the game, there’s a whole second playthrough with Riku with a new story and new battle mechanics. I had to play it. That shit was also bullshit, just like the main game, and there were fewer opportunities to cheese opponents. Still, I did it. Beating Ansem at the end was really hard but I did it. Mickey Mouse randomly appeared. Riku is caught being edgier than ever before. I can’t get over how different this game is to Kingdom Hearts 1.</p>
<h2>Kingdom Hearts 358/2 Days</h2>
<img class="img-responsive" src="assets/icecream.jpg" width="600">
<p>I also plowed through and started the next “game” in the PS4 collection, which by the way has the prize for the most ridiculous game title in this list.</p>
<p>SHIT ISN’T EVEN A GAME! This originally came out on DS and instead of remaking it like Chain of Memories, they just remade the cutscenes, and left out the gameplay. This is particularly wild because this story is part of the Kingdom Hearts lore and they put it in the collection so players can follow the story chronologically. Feels like super bad planning.</p>
<p>About 15 minutes in when I realised this wasn’t a game but rather a 3 hour movie of these terrible graphics I decided to accept the life I chose for myself and sit through it. This was made better by getting super stoned.</p>
<p>I am blown away by the sheer volume of cutscenes of these characters eating ice cream while precariously balancing on the roof of a clocktower watching the sunset. It’s genuinely all they ever do, their only activity. Despite this, the story continues to be baffling and bewildering. At this point I’m so far gone that I’m just letting the bizarre vibes of this entry in the series wash over me. Maybe Kingdom Hearts 2 will be a real game.</p>
